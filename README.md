Hi, I'm Akalanka! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Full Stack Engineer at [qlub](https://qlub.io/ae/en)**, one of the two engineering minds behind [MyTickets.lk](https://mytickets.lk) and the sole engineer behind the [Hiru FM mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microimage.hirufm&hl=en) until its initial release. I joined qlub after they [acquired the previous company I worked in named Spades](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spadesapp) in 2023 and am currently building its loyalty and subscription counterpart with a focus on customer retention and engagement.

While at university, I led the engineering team of an open source community named [SLIIT FOSS](https://sliitfoss.org) and redefined the lost meaning of open source within Sri Lanka. Here are some of the best [OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) I've built **which aren't already pinned in my repositories**:

- [Bashaway Platform](https://github.com/sliit-foss?q=bashaway) - A first of its kind fully automated competition platform hosting dozens of unique challenges unsolvable by AI tools.

- [Elemental](https://elcengine.github.io) - A Golang ODM for MongoDB which combines the best features of [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com), [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io), and [Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/eloquent).

- [Flodash](https://pub.dev/packages/flodash) - A dart implementation of [lodash](https://lodash.com)

- [Enhanced HTTP](https://pub.dev/packages/enhanced_http) - A dart package that extends the built-in HTTP client with an API similar to [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro).

- [Automatic versioning](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sliit-foss/automatic-versioning) - A simplistic Node.js library built as an alternative to [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release).

- [Zelebrate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sliit-foss/zelebrate) - Express middleware which wraps around [Zod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod) to provide a simple but powerful way to validate requests and keep express handlers type-safe.


- [Mongoose Filter Query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sliit-foss/mongoose-filter-query) - Middleware which implements a standardized format to map a http request's query params to mongoose queries.

I use cutting edge technology to build rock solid software solutions in ways you might never have imagined. Opposed to the common belief of a Jack of all trades and a master of none, I have comprehensive experience in multiple key areas such as web, backend, mobile and devops tempered with painstaking attention to detail and a strong focus on performance, security, maintainability and code quality.

Apart from the time I spend on coding, I enjoy travelling and exploring new and dangerous places. For this I'm restoring a [classic Mark 1 Pajero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Pajero#First_generation_(L040-,_L140-_/_NA,_NB,_NC,_ND,_NE,_NF,_NG;_1982)) which I plan to keep with me for the rest of my life.
